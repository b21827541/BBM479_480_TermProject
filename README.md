# Car Crash Anomaly Detection 

## Introduction

Our project focused on detecting car crashes, which we attempted to do using optical flow, pre-trained convolutional neural networks, the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model, recurrent neural networks, and a car crash dataset that included 3000 normal and 1500 crash videos.

The goal of this project was to train a recurrent neural network model to categorize vehicle crash scenarios and observe how it performs with different types of training data based on optical flow, such as magnitude, orientation, magnitude and orientation, and magnitude and orientation with YOLO aspects of the dataset.
